### Project
This package was developed as part of a masters thesis made on the MSc of Cognitive Science on Aarhus University. 
With this package we hope to contribute to the development of methods for quantifying gender bias in Danish language models. 

Our main contribution is the refining and wrapping of existing methods into a coherent test suite. 
Additionally, we have added our own evaluation and visualization functions in order to present the results of the different metrics in a coherent way.

### Acknowledgements
This project uses code from three already implemented frameworks for quantifying gender bias in Danish. 
While all code written by others is properly attributed at the top of the scripts in the repository, we would also like to present aknowledgement here to the authors of the work we draw on:
