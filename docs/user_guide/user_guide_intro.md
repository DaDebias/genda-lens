This user guide contains the definitions of harm and gender bias applied in GenDa Lens. 
Additionally, you find information about how the three types of tests that can be run.

Information on how to run these tests consult along with code examples can be found in the API reference.


Note that for each of the tests we indicate possible harms that can result if an effect of gender is found to have influence of a given task. Additionally we indicate possible sources of bias that could have cause this effect. 
These are only meant as indications. To properly understand possible harms of biased models we recommend looking further into the harm categorization that we employ. You can read more about this under Defnitions.
